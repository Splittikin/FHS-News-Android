Super duper WIP! Any part of the app can change at any time! Here be jank!

To develop:
- Copy the URL to this page at the top
- Open Android Studio
- File
- New
- Project from Version Control
- GitHub
- Sign in with token (You can use the regular sign in button if you want but it's janky and using a token works consistently)
- Select this repository
- Wait
- Keep waiting
- Use the check/green arrow in the top right (next to "Git: ") to apply your changes to this repository
- Use the blue arrow to pull changes in the repository to your system


IF YOU GET THIS ERROR
"Latest AGP supported is 7.2.2, current version is 7.3.1"
DO THIS:
- File (In top left)
- Project Structure
- 'Project' on left sidebar
- Change Android Gradle Plugin Version to 7.2.1
- Click apply
- Change Android Gradle Plugin Version back to 7.2.2
- Click apply again

Notes:
- The backend server is private for the time being. Once it's in a reasonably good and secure state, it will be made public just like this client.
- The iOS client can be found here: https://github.com/mrbfrench/FHSNewsIOS_remote
- The web client can be found here: TBD
